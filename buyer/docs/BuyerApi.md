# **createBuyerAuctionBid**
> CreateBuyerAuctionBidResponse createBuyerAuctionBid(slug, createBuyerAuctionBidRequest)

Place a bid, optionally with a proxy maximum. A WINNING BID IS CHARGED AUTOMATICALLY.

Spends money: if you win, your saved card is charged when the auction closes, with nobody present. Requires buyer:checkout:write AND this key switched on at PUT /v1/buyer/checkout/controls; the bid’s maximum (or amount) is checked against the key’s per-order and daily ceilings.

<a name="createBuyerCartOptimizer"></a>
# **createBuyerCartOptimizer**
> CreateBuyerCartOptimizerResponse createBuyerCartOptimizer()

Cart optimizer: send a shopping list (one item per line, \&quot;2 Charizard Base Set\&quot;) and get the cheapest delivered basket across sellers — one pick per line, items + each seller’s shipping with free-shipping thresholds applied. fewestPackages prefers fewer sellers. Nothing is added to the cart.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import net.crossly.buyer.ApiClient;

import net.crossly.buyer.Configuration;
import net.crossly.buyer.auth.*;

    // Configure HTTP bearer authorization: BuyerOAuth
    HttpBearerAuth BuyerOAuth = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("BuyerOAuth");
    BuyerOAuth.setBearerToken("BEARER TOKEN");

    BuyerApi apiInstance = new BuyerApi(defaultClient);
    try {

<a name="createBuyerCartQuote"></a>
# **createBuyerCartQuote**
> CreateBuyerCartQuoteResponse createBuyerCartQuote()

Price the cart, delivered — item, shipping, tax, total.

Runs the real checkout cascade and returns the totals instead of charging. Nothing is purchased. &#x60;taxComplete: false&#x60; means there is no saved delivery address, so the total is a floor rather than a final figure. &#x60;shippingOptions&#x60; lists each seller’s shipping services; send &#x60;shippingServiceBySeller&#x60; to price a different speed (an id the seller does not offer to the destination is a 400). Optional body: &#x60;{ \&quot;shippingServiceBySeller\&quot;: { \&quot;&lt;sellerUserId&gt;\&quot;: \&quot;&lt;serviceId&gt;\&quot; } }&#x60; — omitted sellers get the cheapest service; &#x60;registryToken&#x60; prices it as a gift shipped to that registry. (No body JSON schema: existing callers POST with none.)

What you can do with one order right now — cancel, confirm receipt, report not received, leave feedback.

    HttpBearerAuth BuyerOAuth = (HttpBearerAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("BuyerOAuth");

<a name="listBuyerCashback"></a>
# **listBuyerCashback**
> ListBuyerCashbackResponse listBuyerCashback(status, page, limit)

Your Scout cashback — pending, confirmed, paid.

Newest first. &#x60;pending&#x60; means an order was reported and the retailer&#39;s return window has not closed; nothing is paid until it does. &#x60;expired&#x60; means a click was never reported as converting, which is the ordinary outcome for most clicks.
